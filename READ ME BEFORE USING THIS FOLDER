---- READ ME BEFORE USING THIS FOLDER ---

This is Oracle TV, one of Accenture's "newest(?)" projects. To put it simply, it is a Dash-board type web program which displays
important news about the company, room schedules, announcements, news about the world, weather in Taguig, and Accenture's and Oracle's 
individual stocks in the business. It is a web-based program which showcases the capabilities of Oracle products like Oracle JET and Oracle
APEX.

DYK: This is the same Oracle that manages the Java programming language.

PREREQUISITES:

Languages:
-- HTML
-- CSS
-- JavaScript, preferably the ff:
	-- Oracle JavaScript Extension Toolkit (Oracle JET) [front-end]
	-- Knockout.js
	-- slick jQuery carousel [front-end]
	-- node JS for server side implementing
	-- jQuery in general

Resources:
-- The JET Site Cookbook: http://www.oracle.com/webfolder/technetwork/jet/jetCookbook.html
-- W3Schools.com: https://www.w3schools.com/ 
-- slick official documentation: http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/
-- Knockout.js: http://knockoutjs.com/
-- Oracle JET documentation: https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E94291_01/jet/reference-jet/index.html

Recommended that you learn Oracle JET basics before jumping into the project on your first few days :)

Documentation is provided in the files called dashboard.html, index.html, and dashboard.js. CSS files included are app.css and styles.css
-- public --> js --> viewModels --> dashboard.html (for the skeletal framework)
-- public --> js --> views --> dashboard.js (for the logic)
-- public --> css --> app.css
-- public --> css --> styles.css

RUNNING THE SOFTWARE:

1. In command line, type 'cd oracle_tv'. Then, type 'nodemon server.js'. 
(Nodemon is a node.js plugin that allows the program to run forever even with changes made to the program ).

2. In your browser, type the ff: "localhost:9998".

USING Oracle JET:

THe folder called App2 is the Oracle JET app mismo.

To see it in action, open cmd line and type "cd oracle_tv" then "cd App2".
Then type "ojet build" to build the program, and "ojet serve" to see it.

GIT stuff:

1. if you have git installed in your PC. Let me tell you that this is the 'trial 2' branch, which is different from the 'master' branch. 
2. In case you made any changes to this branch do the ff:
	a. "git pull" -- to get the latest update from the remote repository
	b. "git add ." -- add changes from all your files
	c. "git commit -m "*insert comment here*" " --- to commit
	d. "git push" -- to push your files to the remote repository.

ISSUES: 

-- refresh function has an issue with constantly appending slides to the carousels. I have used arrays as a rudimentary workaround method, but being a novice front-end web developer, it still has to be improved to get full functionality.

Good luck on your internship and enjoy :).
