----README!------

For people who will use this front-end.

Assuming you have node.js, nodemon, and Oracle JET set up:

1. open command line and cd to 'App2'
2. If you have no issues with the server port, type 'ojet serve' and you're good to go!
2.1. Else, open this folder in a text editor.
2.2. go to scripts > config > oraclejet-serve.js
2.3. In oraclejet-serve.js, go to line 70 and change port number. DO NOT ADD SEMICOLONS AT THE END NOR MANIPULATE IT VOLUNTARILY. "port" : number
2.4. save file, and in CLI perform 'ojet serve' again. 

If all else fails, go to 22.53E until July 20.
